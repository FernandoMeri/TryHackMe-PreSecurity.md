## Day 1: 2025-09-02
### Module: Introduction to Cybersecurity
- **I learned**: The difference between Red Team (attackers) and Blue Team (defenders), and why both are crucial.
- **Tools**: None yet, just conceptual theory.
- **Next step**: Module “How the Web Works.”

# Day 2 - [2025/09/18]
## Day 2: 2025-09-18
### Module: Network Fundamentals
- **I learned**: IP addresses and subnets. Basic network tools: `ping`, `traceroute`, `ipconfig`. How routing and DNS work. .
- **Tools**: None yet, just conceptual theory.
- **Next step**: Module “Intro to LAN.”

# Day 3 - [2025/09/19]
## Day 3: 2025-09-19
### Module: Intro to LAN
 **I learned**: 
  - How local networks are segmented using subnets.
  - The difference between public and private IP addresses.
  - How devices find each other on a LAN (ARP).
- **Commands/uses:** 
  - Using `ipconfig`/`ifconfig` to view my IP on the network.
  - Concepts of `ping` to verify connectivity on the LAN.
- **Next step**: Module “OSI Model.”

## Day 3 - [2025/09/19]
### Module: OSI Model
- **I learned**:
- The 7 layers: Physical, Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application.
- **Reflection**: 
  - The module reflects the basis for understanding how data travels and how it is attacked.
- **Next step**: Module “Packets & Frames”.

## Day 3 - [2025/09/19]
### Module: Packets & Frames
- **I learned**: 
  - Differences between frames (Ethernet, layer 2) and packets (IP, layer 3).
  - How TCP's Three-Way Handshake works (SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK).
  - Characteristics of UDP (connectionless, faster but less reliable).
  - Practice with common ports and services (e.g., 80=HTTP, 53=DNS).
- **Application in cybersecurity**:
  - Basis for traffic analysis with Wireshark.
  - Port scanning with tools such as Nmap.
- **Next step**: Module "Extending your netwrok"

## Day 3 - [2025/09/19]
### Module: Extending Your Network
- **I learned**:
  - **Port forwarding**: How to redirect external traffic to internal devices.
  - **Firewalls**: How they filter traffic based on rules (e.g., blocking ports).
  - **VPNs**: How to create secure tunnels for remote access.
  - **LAN devices**: Routers, switches, and their roles in the network.
- **Application in pentesting**:
  - Bypassing firewalls and using port forwarding to access internal systems.
  - Auditing VPN configurations in corporate environments.
